<h1>A Few Poems by Ogden Nash</h1>
<h4>The Panther </h4>
<p>The panther is like a leopard,
    Except it hasn't been peppered.
    Should you behold a panther crouch,
    Prepare to say Ouch.
    Better yet, if called by a panther,
    Don't anther.</p>
    <h4>Lines on Facing Forty</h4>
    <p>I have a bone to pick with fate,
        Come here and tell me girly,
        Do you think my mind is maturing late,
        Or simply rotting early.</p>
        <h4>The Lama</h4>
        <p>The one-l lama,
            He's a priest.
            The two-l llama,
            He's a beast.
            And I will bet
            A silk pajama
            There isn't any
            Three-l lllama.</p>
